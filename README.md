# Fashion MNIST Classification with CNN 🧠👕👖

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset using TensorFlow/Keras.

## 📊 Dataset
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images—consisting of 60,000 training and 10,000 test grayscale images, 28x28 pixels, labeled in 10 classes.

## 🧠 Model Architecture
- Conv2D + ReLU
- MaxPooling2D
- Flatten
- Dense (Softmax)


## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then open the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook cnn_fashion_mnist.ipynb
```

## 🧪 Dependencies
- tensorflow
- keras
- numpy
- matplotlib
